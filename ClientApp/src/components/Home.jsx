                of 1,500 miles to get to your plate- thatâ€™s a lot, and this
                shipping contributes significantly to fossil fuel usage and
                pollution. Local farm food is transported shorter distances and
                has a far better impact on the earth.{' '}

                -Eating healthier food! So much of the food found in grocery
                stores is highly processed and grown using harsh pesticides, and
                the meat is often full of hormones and antibiotics.{' '}
